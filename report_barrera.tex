\subsection{Why is this research question
relevant?}\label{why-is-this-research-question-relevant}}

Education in Colombia and other middle-income countries face challenges
such as high dropout rates among low-income students, and the reasons
behind them, such as the high cost of education. Conditional cash
transfers (CCTs) are an evidence-based intervention to increase
participation in education. However, the authors highlight that there is
little variability in the structure of programmes. The paper
investigates if changes in the timing of payments affect the outcomes of
interest: Attendance and re-enrollment. Optimising the structure of CCTs
may contribute to improved education outcomes and reduce disparities in
access to education.

We investigated performing the replication with the data provided as
part of the lecture. However, we soon discovered that the file did not
contain all required variables, nor was there any meta data or other
information about the variables in the dataset. A brief search revealed
that the data and STATA scripts used to obtain the authors' results are

For this project, we reference the following files: * Data file:

Data were collected in San Christobal (``Basic'' and ``Savings''

different sources: * SISBEN surveys 2003 and 2004: Baseline data on
eligible families * Programme registration data: Basic information on
students * Administrative records: Enrollment records * Direct
observation in 68 out of 251 schools: Attendance data in last quarter of
2005 for 7,158 students. * Survey in 68 schools: Baseline data
collection in 2005. * Survey in 68 schools: Follow-up in 2006.

Key variables for the replication of Table 3 are the outcome variable,
\emph{at\_msamean}. This measures the percentage of days absent using a

0 and 1 (scale).

\subsection{Research design}\label{research-design}}

The research paper describes three interventions designed to improve
attendance and educational outcomes for students in Colombia.

The first intervention (``basic'') is similar to the
PROGRESA/OPORTUNIDADES program, a conditional cash transfer program in
Mexico that operated from 1997 to 2012. It pays participants 30,000
pesos per month (approximately USD 15) if the child attends at least
80\% of the days in that month. Payments are made bi-monthly through a
dedicated debit card, and students will be removed from the program if
they fail to meet attendance targets or are expelled from school.

The second intervention, called the savings treatment, pays two-thirds
of the monthly amount (20,000 pesos or USD 10) to students' families on
a bi-monthly basis, while the remaining one-third is held in a bank
account. The accumulated funds are then made available to students'
families during the period in which students prepare to enroll for the
next school year, with 100,000 pesos (US\$50) available to them in
December if they reach the attendance target every month.

The third intervention, called the tertiary treatment, incentivizes
students to graduate and matriculate to a higher education institution.
The monthly transfer for good attendance is reduced from 30,000 pesos
per month to 20,000 pesos, but upon graduating, the student earns the
right to receive a transfer of 600,000 pesos (USD 300) if they enroll in
a tertiary institution, and after a year if they fail to enroll upon
graduation.

Students were removed from the program if they fail to meet attendance
targets, fail to matriculate to the next grade twice, or are expelled
from school.

In our replication, we focus on the first and second intervention.

The eligibility criteria for the ``basic'' and ``savings'' experiments
were as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Children had to have finished grade 5 and be enrolled in grades 6 -
  10.
\item
  The children's families had to be classified into the bottom two
  categories on Colombia's poverty index (SISBEN).
\item
  Only households living in San Cristobal prior to 2004 were eligible to
  participate.
\end{itemize}

The paper investigates differences in enrollment and graduation /
progression to tertiary education for the three treatment groups
compared to untreated controls. Randomization to treatment vs control
group was stratified by location, school public vs private, gender and
grade.

\hypertarget{data-preparation}{%
\subsection{Data preparation}\label{data-preparation}}

We imported the data file from STATA format and prepared it for analysis
by first turning categorical variables into factors. For convenience
when producing graphs, we combined the three treatment indicators into a
single factor variable with four expressions (0 = control group, 1 = T1,
2 = T2, 3 = T3).

We then translated the STATA commands to filter the data in line with
the inclusion criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dropping ineligible cases from Suba: Drop if suba == 1
\item
  Keeping only those who were selected for the survey in schools:
  survey\_selected == 1
\item
  Drop if grade is \textless{} 6 or grade is 11
\end{itemize}

The dataset for our analysis is called \emph{filtered\_barrera}.

\hypertarget{what-are-the-assumptions-of-the-method}{%
\subsubsection{What are the assumptions of the
method?}\label{what-are-the-assumptions-of-the-method}}

The authors initially use simple linear regression to compare treatment
groups. They model the relationship between a dependent variable
(outcome; attendance) and two independent variables (whether participant
is allocated to treatment ``basic'', and whether participant is
allocated to treatment ``savings''.)

The assumptions about the data underlying linear regression are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the
  independent and dependent variables.
\item
  Independence: The observations used in the regression analysis should
  be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one
  observation should not be influenced by the value of another
  observation.
\item
  Homoscedasticity: The variance of the dependent variable should be
  constant across all values of the independent variable(s).
\item
  Normality: The dependent variable should be normally distributed at
  each level of the independent variable(s).
\item
  No multicollinearity: If there are multiple independent variables in
  the regression model, there should be no high correlation between
  these independent variables.
\end{enumerate}

If these assumptions are not met, this can lead to unreliable estimators
(regression coefficients) and / or biased standard errors, i.e.~standard
errors that are systematically smaller or larger than the ``true''
standard error. This means that the relationship between dependent and
independent variables is not estimated correctly by the model.

\hypertarget{are-these-assumptions-plausible-in-this-example}{%
\subsubsection{Are these assumptions plausible in this
example?}\label{are-these-assumptions-plausible-in-this-example}}

We test the assumptions of the simplest regression model using the
procedure detailed

We can see that a large proportion of each sample has an attendance
record above the 80\% requirement, explaining the skew of the
distribution observed in the box plots. It is therefore unlikely that

\hypertarget{model-specifications}{%
\subsection{Model specifications}\label{model-specifications}}

In addition to the above, one violation that should be expected based on
the data is that of independence. It is likely that there are unobserved
characteristics at the school level (e.g.~school culture and rules) that
affect the outcome. The following equations show formally how the
analyses were conceptualised(where i is the individual and j is the
school). While the authors state that standard errors are clustered also
clustered within the individual, the STATA code suggests that the only
clustering variable was the school (\emph{school code}), and this is
what we have replicated below.

Model 1:
\[ y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{B} Basic_i + \beta_{S} Savings_i + \epsilon_{ij} \]
Model 1 is a simple linear model with only treatment allocation as the
dependent variable, while model 2 also includes a collection of student
and household characteristics.

Model 2:
\[ y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{B} Basic_i + \beta_{S} Savings_i + \delta X_{ijk} + \theta_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \]

Model 3 builds on model two, but includes a fixed effect for the school
level. Fixed effect models are used to control for unobserved factors
that affect the outcome variable. In this case, the school was chosen as
the fixed effect.

Part of the problem with this model is the outcome variable, which has a
ceiling effect (can't go above 100\%, and many people have high
attendance, with target attendance also being high at 80\%.)

It may be worthwhile investigating whether there is a significant
difference in the proportion above the cut-off between samples.

\includegraphics{report_barrera_files/figure-latex/expl-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   T1T2T3       prop_cutoff
##   <fct>              <dbl>
## 1 Control            0.765
## 2 Basic (T1)         0.814
## 3 Savings (T2)       0.798
\end{verbatim}

Variability in the outcome variable is limited because most students
attend at least 80\% of the time. An alternative model specification may
be to analyse differences in proportion of attendance (above / below
cut-off).

Alternative way of approaching this: GLM for skewed data (e.g.~log link
and gamma function --\textgreater{} would need to fit this more
carefully, ) Binary variable: Whether or not student achieved 80\%
attendance

\includegraphics{report_barrera_files/figure-latex/glm-1.pdf}

GLM with binary outcome variable performs much better on AIC. But I'm
not sure the residual plots help us very much as it's not clustered SE!
